### easy
-Try changing the color of the material. All the normal colors like red, green, or blue will work, along with many more exotic colors such as peachpuff, orchid, or papayawhip. Here’s a complete list of the CSS color names.

-Try changing the color of the light. Again, you can use any of the CSS color names. Watch how setting various light and material colors give the cube its final color.

-Try moving the light around (using light.position) and observe the result.

### medium
-Test out the other direct light types: PointLight, SpotLight, and RectAreaLight.

-MeshBasicMaterial and MeshStandardMaterial are not the only materials available. There are a total of eighteen materials in the three.js core, and any material with the word “mesh” in its name will work with our cube mesh. Test some of these out (hint: search the docs for “material”).

note-You need to import the other light and material classes 
before you can use them!

### hard

Recreate the scene from Lighting and Depth, minus the animation (hint: use two meshes and two materials).
